## 🛠️ 4. UART Serial Console (Optional)

For headless setup or troubleshooting, connect a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial adapter:

| FTDI Pin | Zero 3W Pin |
|----------|-------------|
| GND      | GND         |
| TX       | RX          |
| RX       | TX          |

**How to connect:**
- **Linux/macOS:**  
  ```bash
  screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
  ```
- **Windows:**  
  Use [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) or [Tera Term](https://osdn.net/projects/ttssh2/releases/).

!!! info "Why use UART?"
    UART gives you direct access to the board’s console, even if HDMI is not working or you’re running headless.

## ⚡ 5. First Boot

1. Insert the flashed microSD card into the Radxa Zero 3W.
2. Connect HDMI, keyboard, and mouse (if using desktop mode).
3. Connect the power supply via USB-C.
4. Wait for the system to boot. The first boot may take a few minutes as the OS resizes the filesystem and initializes.

**Default login credentials:**
- Username: `radxa`
- Password: `radxa`

!!! warning "Change your password!"
    For security, change your password immediately after first login:
    ```bash
    passwd
    ```

## 🔄 6. Update Your System

After logging in, update your packages for the latest features and security patches:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
This ensures your system is up to date and secure.

## 🌐 7. Connect to the Internet

- **Wi-Fi:**  
  - Desktop: Use the network manager icon in the taskbar.
  - Terminal: Run `nmtui` and follow the prompts to connect to your Wi-Fi network.
- **Ethernet:**  
  - Use a USB-to-Ethernet adapter for a wired connection. Most adapters are plug-and-play.

!!! tip "Headless Wi-Fi setup"
    You can pre-configure Wi-Fi by editing `wpa_supplicant.conf` on the SD card’s `/boot` partition before first boot (if supported by your OS image).
